## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   SCSS variables, functions, and mixins
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Javascript

### What I learned

-   How to create a tooltip/toast with CSS.
-   About the defer property in the scrip tag.

### Continued development

-   I want to find a better solution to creating a toast, where it is more responsive on its own instead of relying on media query.
-   I also want to start creating my own library of reusable components like buttons and tooltips, maybe create a library and use npm to add it to each project.
